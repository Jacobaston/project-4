## Overview

## The Brief

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own back-end and your own front-end
* **Use an Flask API** to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.

## Technologies Used

### Back-end:

### Frontend:

### Development tools:
- VS code
- NPM 
- Insomnia
- Git
- Github
- Google Chrome dev tools
- Heroku (deployment)

## Approach taken

### Day 1 - Planning

### Back-end - Day 2 & 3

### Front-end - Day 4, 5, 6, 7

### Deployment

The app was then deployed through Heroku. Initially we linked up the front-end to the back-end and tested locally, and once we were happy with this then hit the deploy button on Heroku through the CLI. Once the app was then deployed online we seeded in the relevent data.
