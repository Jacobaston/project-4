# Garms

## Overview

## The Brief

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own back-end and your own front-end
* **Use an Flask API** to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.

## Technologies Used

### Back-end:

### Frontend:

### Development tools:
- VS code
- Pipenv/npm
- Insomnia
- Git
- Github
- Google Chrome dev tools
- Heroku (deployment)
- Trello Board (planning and timeline)
- PhotoShop (wireframing)
- Zoom
- Slack

## Approach taken

### Day 1 - Planning

As a group we decided very quickly on the idea of Garms for this project and that we all wanted to be involved in the full-stack development of the app. We also decided early on that we should develop it to be fully responsive initially built mobile first. With that in mind we used photoshop to create a storyboard/wireframe as well QuickDBD for the models we required and the relationships between them.

We decided early on to keep a high level of communication throughout the project. We started each day with a 30-minute stand up discussion where we would talk about our current tasks and if we had any blockers. We were then on a Zoom meeting and Slack throughout the day so we could keep in contact should we need any quick bug fixing etc. We used Git and GitHub for version control and decided for the first few days to do our pushes and pulls together to aviod any potential Git issues or merge conflicts that may arise. We delegated the work evenly between us and used Trello to create a to-do list that we would all keep on top of throughout the project.

### Back-end - Day 2 & 3

### Front-end - Day 4, 5, 6, 7

### Deployment

The app was then deployed through Heroku. Initially we linked up the front-end to the back-end and tested locally, and once we were happy with this then hit the deploy button on Heroku through the CLI. Once the app was then deployed online we seeded in the relevent data.
